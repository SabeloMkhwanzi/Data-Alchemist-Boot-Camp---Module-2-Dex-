#### Covalent: Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp

- Fantom & Ethereum mainnet DEX analyse (FTM/ETH) Uniswap @Ethereum - Sushiswap @Fantom

#### Link: [Module 2: FTM/ETH DEX Analysis](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/increment/pages/sabelo/module-2-ftmeth-dex-analysis/)

#### To complete the challenge for Module 2, choose one token from one of the projects you analysed in Module 1.

##### In my Data-Alchemist I did consideration the tokens on my previous chains I worked on that which Ethereum chain used (ETH) as my token analysis, than Fantom chain used FTM token as analysis. as mentioned before the reason for picking this chains Fantom is fast, scalable platform for decentralized applications, easy to integrate existing dApps, and a suitable for building decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, which can primary attract more users and developers resulting in mass adoption for Fantom to grow - that what we want to measure here.

#### These are the following analysis we will be completing:
1. Reach:
- Number of traders, Number of new traders, Number of trades 

2. Retention:
- Mint-to-burn ratio for LPs vs. market volatility, MoM Trader Retention **(Cohort Chart)**, Trader Stickiness Ratio

3. Revenue: 
- Pools TVL,  Pools Volume, Median LP liquidity provided over time, Liquidity Utilization Over the Last 24 hours **(Metric Chart)**

##### 1. Reach
![Number of traders](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Reach%20-%20Number%20of%20traders%20%26%20%202022-11-23%20.jpg)
- Number of traders and trades: In terms of the number of traders and trades, Sushiswap @Fantom has more traders and trades than  Uniswap @Ethereum V2. 
- Number of new vs existing traders seemms to rapidly decrease compare to previous this could be the cause events that has been happend and bearish season.

- Number of traders and trades: In terms of the number of traders and trades, Sushiswap @Fantom has more traders and trades than  Uniswap @Ethereum V2. 
- Number of new vs existing traders seemms to rapidly decrease compare to previous this could be the cause events that has been happend and bearish season.

##### 2. Retention
![Mint-to-burn ratio for LPs vs. market volatility](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Retention%20-%20Mint-to-burn%20ratio%20-%20LPs%20vs.%20MV%20-%20Uniswap%202022-11-23%20.jpg)
- Mint-to-burn ratio is the ratio of tokens going into the pool and tokens leaving the pool. The highest mint-to-burn ratio both on Uni V2 and Uniswap happened on 5th April 2022 and 30th April 2022 when the price was at its peak.

![MoM Trader Retention](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Retention%20-%20MoM%20Trader%20Retention%20-%20Uniswap-Suhsi%20V2%20FTM-ETH%202022-11-23%20.jpg)
![Trader Stickiness Ratio](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Retention%20-%20Trader%20Stickiness%20Ratio%20%20FTM-ETH%20%202022-11-23%20.jpg)
- Stickiness ratio is the rate at which the users return to the product on a regular basis. Stickiness is equal to the ratio of daily active users (DAUs) to monthly active users (MAUs). When comparing Uniswap @Ethereum vs Sushiswap @Fantom (FTM/ETH), We can see that Uniswap @Ethereum takes lead at 84% of 48% ushiswap @Fantom, Which bring an awareness that ethereum still has a massive attraction.

##### 3. Revenue
![Pools TVL ](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Revenue%20-%20TVL%20(USD)%20-%20FTM-ETH%20pair%20on%20Sushiswap%20Fantom%202022-11-23%20.jpg)
![Pools TVL](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Revenue%20-%20Pools%20Volume%20-%20FTM-WETH%20Pool%20on%20Uniswap%20V2%20(Fantom)%202022-11-23%20.jpg)
- TVL is the overall value of assets (in USD) deposited across all DeFi protocols or in a single DeFi project. TVL here is calculated by the sum amount of deposit (add liquidity) minus the withdrawal (remove liquidity) + sum of swap volume, where the value is in USD. 

![ Median LP liquidity provided over time](https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/Data-Alchemist-Boot-Camp-Module-2-Dex-/blob/main/Revenue%20-%20Liquidity%20Utilization%20Over%20FTM-ETH%20Uniswap%202022-11-23.jpg)

#### To considerations Uniswap V2 has higher liquidity and user adoption last 30 days, Stickiness ratio is high with comparison between Uniswap @Ethereum vs Sushiswap @Fantom v2 , it's clear that FTM/ETH on Uniswap V2 outperforms Sushiswap V2.

#### Thank you for the @Covalent_HQ Data Alchemist BootCamp I must say I'm really enjoy, learnnig alot. 

#### Happy Data Alchemis!ðŸ˜Š
